**Process impact:** The SRS precisely defines the software product that
will be built. Decisions made in writing the SRS are based on
information in the [project proposal](proposal) and [user
needs](user-needs) documents. The SRS sets requirements that must
be satisfied by the [system design](design). The SRS is verified
and validated by activities outlined in the [QA plan](qa-plan.html).

  organized way.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*TODO: Describe the non-functional requirements for this release. Some
examples are provided below.*

#### What are the usability requirements?

::Our main criteria for making the system usable is the difficulty of
performing each high-frequency use case. Difficulty depends on the
number of steps, the knowledge that the user must have at each step,
the decisions that the user must make at each step, and the
mechanics of each step (e.g., typing a book title exactly is hard,
clicking on a title in a list is easy).

::The user interface should be as familiar as possible to users who
have used other web applications and Windows desktop applications.
E.g., we will follow the UI guidelines for naming menus, buttons,
and dialog boxes whenever possible.

::PARAGRAPH

Details:

- ::Government customers will demand [section508
  compliance](http://www.section508.gov/)
- ::Support learnability with principles of [Instructive
  Interaction](http://www.foruse.com/articles/instructive.htm)
- ::The customer wants extensive on-line help, but is not demanding
  a printed manual.

#### What are the maintainability and upgradability requirements?

::Maintainability is our ability to make changes to the product
over time. We need strong maintainability in order to retain our
early customers. We will address this by anticipating several types
of change, and by carefully documenting our design
and implementation.

::Upgradability is our ability to cost-effectively deploy new versions
of the product to customers with minimal downtime or disruption. A
key feature supporting this goal is automatic download of patches
and upgrade of the end-user's machine. Also, we shall use data file
formats that include enough meta-data to allow us to reliably
transform existing customer data during an upgrade.

#### What are the supportability and operability requirements?

::Supportability is our ability to provide cost effective
technical support. Our goal is to limit our support costs to only 5%
of annual licensing fees. The product's automatic upgrade feature
will help us easily deploy defect fixes to end-users. The user guide
and product website will include a troubleshooting guide and
checklist of information to have at hand before contacting
technical support.

::Operability is our ability to host and operate the software as an
ASP (Application Service Provider). The product features should help
us achieve our goal of 99.9% uptime (at most 43 minutes downtime
each month). Key features supporting that are the ability to do hot
data backups, and application monitoring.

happens to that product over a period of several years, from initial
purchase decision, through important but infrequent use cases, until
product retirement. Key life-cycle requirements are listed below.

Details:

- ::Customers must be able to manage the number of licenses that
  they have and make informed decisions to purchase more licenses
  when needed
- ::The product shall support daily operations and our year-end
  audit
- ::The customer data shall be stored in a format that is still
  accessible even after the application has been retired
