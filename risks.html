**Process impact:** This document records the major project risks, and
plans to control them. For each risk the plan should include:

- Mitigation plan
  - Measures you will carry out now, to reduce the likelihood and/or
    impact of the risk. Alternatively, you can decide to accept
    the risk.
- Indicator
  - A sign you will monitor to determine if the risk is beginning to
    have an impact on the project.
- Contingency plan
  - What you will do if the risk does arise. You can specify some
    general contingency plans. In this case you only need to give a
    contingency plan if you have a special one for the particular risk.

The severity of a risk is its likelihood multiplied by its impact. Risks
are classified as minor if they have low likelihood, negligible impact,
or medium likelihood and marginal impact.

*TODO: You should update these lists regularly. They should be reviewed
by customers and developers from time to time.*

### General contingency plans
&nbsp;

#### Catastrophic risks

::If a catastrophic risk occurs we will make an honest reassessment of
the viability of the project and involve the relevant
project stakeholders.

::If a catastrophic risk occurs we will cancel the project. We will
take away our lessons learned and any valuable project bi-products.

::We do not recognize any catastrophic risks. If one occurs we will
pretend everything is fine and hope that none of the
stakeholders notice.

#### Risks that consume development resources.
::The project has a fixed deadline. The requirements are prioritized.
If we lose time, we will reduce project scope.

::The features specified are all essential If we lose time, we will
delay delivery.

::If we lose time, we will make time estimates for the remaining
features, and meet with the customers to reconsider scope and
delivery date.

| ::Requirements  | Requirements are only partly known at project start. Customers may not allocate sufficient resources to exploring requirements. | Medium     | Critical to Catastrophic | Requirements will be detailed first for the top priority goals. Indicator: Track the rate at which requirements are discovered. Contingency: request more customer effort.    | Amber  | Requirements Lead | 
| ::Goals         | Stakeholders goals may conflict.                                                                                                | Medium     | Critical                 | Keep an explicit list of stakeholders goals.

They are dispersed among several sites, and have not worked together before.        | Medium     | Critical                 | Use these [tools](sdm#communication) to help communication. The main indicator of miscommunication will be software defects detected by our [QA activity](qa-plan).           | Green  | QA lead           |

### Minor risks

*TODO: Review this list regularly, to decide whether the likelihood or
impact of a risk has increased to make it a "major" risk.*

| ::Estimate        | The development team might not be able to estimate the work time, preventing customers from deciding priorities effectively.                                                                 | Medium                | Marginal                                           | The development team will gain experience in estimating the work, and deliver the first estimates after 12 months.

Indicator: a developer saying "I think they mean ...", a customer saying "They know what I mean". Contingency: request customer review of requirements. | Green                 | Customers       | 
| ::Changes         | After requirements have been documented and agreed, development activities begin to based on them, first design then implementation.

Indicator: compare cost of change to new development. Contingency: request customer review of requirements.                                                                                              | Green                 | Project Manager |

#### Possible risk status values
&nbsp;
##### Red
Active & impacting project

##### Amber
Active but contained without impact to scope or delivery time.

##### Green
Not yet active

### Risk Checklist

#### Do the plans provide an indicator to detect each of the risks becoming active?
::Yes, if all activies are carried out as planned, we will know if any
of the risks is becoming troublesome.

::No, some risks could creep up on us.

#### Are the right "risk owners" assigned to monitor the risks?
::Yes, for each risk the assigned owner can detect the indicator, can
launch the contingency plan, and is the person who will suffer by
the risk.

::No, in some cases the assigned owner may not notice or care, or does
not have sufficient authority.

#### Does each risk have a mitigation strategy, or is the risk acceptable?
::Yes, we have plans to control each risk.

::Yes, we have plans to control some risks, and have accepted others.

::No, this plan leaves open several risks.

#### Does each risk have a contingency plan?
::Yes, most risks cost development time and the general plan applies,
and for each of the others there is a contingency plan above.

::No, there are some risks we still have to plan for.

#### Has this Risk Control Plan been communicated to the development team and other stakeholders?
::Yes, this document is being posted to the project website. It will
also be discussed at an early team meeting, and discussed with the
customers before the commit to the project. Comments are welcome.

::No, our culture does not allow discussion of risks.

#### Is there a procedure in place for identifying new risks and reviewing the existing ones?
::TBD

#### In the light of these risks, is the project worth carrying out?
::Yes, it is a low risk project

::No, other projects can deliver as much value at lower risk.

::Yes. It is an unusually risky project by commercial standards, but
we believe we have adequate plans here, considering the value that
the project could deliver.

#### Is there an anonymous reporting channel, to allow developers to communicate concerns to senior management?
::Yes

::No, everything depends on the alertness and strength of character of
the project manager.
