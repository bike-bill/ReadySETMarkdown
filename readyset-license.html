Do not modify or delete this file. This file describes the license under
which you may use the ReadySET templates.

### License FAQ

---

#### Can I use these templates at my company?

Yes, absolutely. Once you fill in the template with detailed
information about a specific project, you are free to do what you
want with them in the context of that project. ***You may even hide the
template copyright statement***: the best way to do that is to edit the
file inst.css.

#### Can I modify these templates for use on several projects at my company?   

Yes, absolutely. You may modify and distribute these templates to
others, so long as you retain this file and the footnote with the
copyright statement clearly visible in each file.

#### Can I include these templates as part of a commercial product?

If you use the templates and fill in details about a given product,
go ahead. If you are thinking of making a product that includes the
templates for use *as templates*, you must retain this file and the
copyright statement in a visible footnote. An enhanced commercial
version of these templates, [ReadySETPro](http://www.readysetpro.com/), 
is already in development

#### Can I combine these templates with other templates or documents?

Sure, go ahead. This license is not "viral", it does not mean that
anything you do must be open source or covered under the
same license.

#### If I enhance the templates, must I give those enhancements back to the open source project?

No, but it would be very welcome. Even if you don't modify the
templates, you can share your "words of wisdom". For more
information on contributing, see the [ReadySET home
page](http://readyset.tigris.org/).

#### ReadySET seems too good to be true. What is the catch? Why would anyone buy a commercial version?

There is no catch. However, the scope of ReadySET is limited to only
most common needs of development projects. It is easy to get started
with ReadySET, but [ReadySET Pro](http://www.readysetpro.com/) holds
much more value for corporate users.
